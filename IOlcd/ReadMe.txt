Hi,
the files in here are for arduino 1.0,
the file under IOlcdpre1_0 are for previous versions of arduino ide.
and if they don't work give me a call, 
so I might be able to fix it,

update 23-10-2012 :
Rewrote code, the syntax has changed a little and i'll fix the the syntax to comply with that :)
Also i'll update the page on how to make it work:
